# SQL Server Import extension

The SQL Server Import extension converts .txt and .csv files into a SQL table. This wizard utilizes a Microsoft Research framework known as [Program Synthesis using Examples (PROSE)](https://microsoft.github.io/prose/) to intelligently parse the file with minimal user input. it's a powerful framework for data wrangling, and it's the same technology that powers Flash Fill-in Microsoft Excel

To learn more about the SSMS version of this feature, you can read [this article](../../relational-databases/import-export/import-flat-file-wizard.md).
