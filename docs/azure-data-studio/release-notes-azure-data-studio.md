| Azure Arc extension | [Known Issue:](https://github.com/microsoft/azuredatastudio/issues/13319) The "Script to Notebook" button for Arc MIAA & PG deployments doesn't do field validation before scripting the notebook. This means that if users enter the password wrong in the password confirm inputs then they may end up with a notebook that has the wrong value for the password.| The "Deploy" button works as expected though so users should use that instead. |
| Object Explorer | Releases of Azure Data Studio before 1.24.0 have a breaking change in object explorer because of the engine's changes related to [Azure Synapse Analytics serverless SQL pool](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/on-demand-workspace-overview). | To continue utilizing object explorer in Azure Data Studio with Azure Synapse Analytics serverless SQL pool, you need to use Azure Data Studio 1.24.0 or later. |
