# Configuring Delta Lake on SQL Server Big Data Clusters

## Introduction

Linux Foundation Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads. To learn more about Delta Lake, see:

* [What is Delta Lake](/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-what-is-delta-lake)
* [Introduction to Delta Lake](https://docs.delta.io/0.6.1/delta-intro.html)

## Configure Delta Lake on SQL Server Big Data Clusters

On SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters, it is possible to load Delta Lake libraries using the [Spark library management](spark-install-packages.md) feature.

> [!NOTE]
   > As a general rule, use the most recent compatible library. The code in this guide was tested by using Delta Lake 0.6.1 on SQL Server Big Data Clusters CU11. Delta Lake 0.6.1 is compatible with Apache Spark 2.4.x, later versions are not. The examples are provided as-is, not a supportability statement.

### Configure Delta Lake library and Spark configuration options

Set up your Delta Lake libraries with your application before you submit the jobs. The following library is required:

* [delta-core](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.delta/delta-core) - This core library enables Delta Lake support.

The library must target Scala 2.11 and Spark 2.4.7. This SQL Server Big Data Cluster requirement is for SQL 2019 Cumulative Update 9 (CU9) or later.

It's also required to configure Spark to enable Delta Lake-specific Spark SQL commands and the metastore integration. The example bellow is how an Azure Data Studio notebook would configure Delta Lake support:

```python
%%configure -f \
{
    "conf": {
        "spark.jars.packages": "io.delta:delta-core_2.11:0.6.1",
        "spark.sql.extensions":"io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension",
        "spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog":"org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog"
    }
}
```

#### Share library locations for jobs on HDFS

If multiple applications will use the Delta Lake library, copy the appropriate library JAR files to a shared location on HDFS. Then all jobs should reference the same library files.

Copy the libraries to the common location:

```bash
azdata bdc hdfs cp --from-path delta-core_2.11-0.6.1.jar --to-path "hdfs:/apps/jars/delta-core_2.11-0.6.1.jar"
```

#### Dynamically install the libraries

You can dynamically install packages when you submit a job by using the [package management features](spark-install-packages.md) of Big Data Clusters. There's a job startup time penalty because of the recurrent downloads of the library files on each job submission.

### Submit the Spark job by using azdata

The following example uses the shared library JAR files on HDFS:

```bash
azdata bdc spark batch create -f hdfs:/apps/ETL-Pipelines/my-delta-lake-python-job.py \
-j '["/apps/jars/delta-core_2.11-0.6.1.jar"]' \
--config '{"spark.sql.extensions":"io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension","spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog":"org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog"}' \
-n MyETLPipelinePySpark --executor-count 2 --executor-cores 2 --executor-memory 1664m
```

This example uses dynamic package management to install the dependencies:

```bash
azdata bdc spark batch create -f hdfs:/apps/ETL-Pipelines/my-delta-lake-python-job.py \
--config '{"spark.jars.packages":"io.delta:delta-core_2.11:0.6.1","spark.sql.extensions":"io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension","spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog":"org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog"' \
-n MyETLPipelinePySpark --executor-count 2 --executor-cores 2 --executor-memory 1664m
```
