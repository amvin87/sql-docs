# Administration resources for Big Data Clusters (BDC)

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019.md)]

This article describes how to administer a [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] from outside in.

## Know your architecture

Starting with SQL Server 2019 (15.x), [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] allow you to deploy scalable clusters of SQL Server, Spark, and HDFS containers running on Kubernetes. For an overview of [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)], see [What are SQL Server Big Data Clusters](big-data-cluster-overview.md).

[!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] provide coherent and consistent authorization and authentication. For an overview of big data cluster security, see [Security concepts for [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)]](concept-security.md).

## Manage and operate with tools

The following articles describe how to manage and operate Big Data Cluster in the following ways: 

- [Connect to a SQL Server big data cluster with Azure Data Studio](connect-to-big-data-cluster.md)
- [Manage big data clusters for SQL Server controller dashboard](manage-with-controller-dashboard.md)
- [Manage SQL Server Big Data Clusters with Azure Data Studio notebooks](notebooks-manage-bdc.md)
- [Manage Big Data Clusters (BDC) the cluster with notebooks](cluster-manage-notebooks.md)
- [Run a sample notebook using Spark](notebooks-tutorial-spark.md)

## Monitor with tools

The following articles describe how to monitor Big Data Cluster in the following ways: 

- [Monitor BDC Cluster with Azure Data Studio](cluster-monitor-ads.md)
- [Monitor BDC Cluster with Azdata utility](cluster-monitor-cmdlet.md)
- [Monitor BDC Cluster with Grafana Dashboard](cluster-monitor-grafana.md)
- [Monitor BDC Cluster with Juypter notebooks and Azure Data Studio](cluster-monitor-notebooks.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Internet Explorer browser and older Microsoft Edge browsers are not compatible with Grafana and Kibana. Consider the [Chromium-based Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedgewelcome.microsoft.com/), or review the [supported browsers for Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/requirements/#supported-web-browsers) and [supported browsers for Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_browsers).

## Monitor and inspect logs with notebooks

The following articles list many of the Jupyter notebooks that are available in Azure Data Studio.

- [Monitoring cluster with notebooks](cluster-monitor-notebooks.md)
- [Gathering and analyzing logs in the cluster with notebooks](cluster-logging-notebooks.md)

## Big Data Clusters troubleshooting resources

The following articles describe how to troubleshoot Big Data Cluster:

- [Troubleshoot BDC Cluster with kubectl utility](cluster-troubleshooting-commands.md) 
- [Troubleshoot pyspark notebook](troubleshoot-pyspark-notebook.md)
- [Troubleshoot BDC Cluster with Juypter notebooks and Azure Data Studio (ADS)](cluster-troubleshooter-notebooks.md)
- [Restore HDFS permissions](troubleshoot-hdfs-restore-admin.md)

The following articles describe how to troubleshoot Big Data Cluster deployed in Active Directory mode:
- [Troubleshoot BDC Cluster in Active Directory Mode](troubleshoot-active-directory.md) 
- [Troubleshoot AD mode login fails](troubleshoot-ad-login-failed-untrusted-domain.md)
- [Troubleshoot BDC AD mode deployment stopped](troubleshoot-ad-reverse-lookup-zone.md)


## Where to find [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] administration notebooks 

[!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] provides comprehensive administration experience working with Jupyter notebooks. The provided notebooks cover cluster operations, management, monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting. 


### Access to local notebooks 

After you managed to connect to a BDC cluster with Azure Data Studio (ADS), you can go to '[!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)]' tab and find the direct link to all the local notebooks, as shown below: 

![BDC local guides](media/view-cluster-status/bdc-local-guides.png)

You can also gain access to the notebooks directly from Azure Data Studio (ADS). Use keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl + Shift + P', or 'View' and select on 'Command Palette', to find the option 'Jupyter Books: Get localized SQL Server 2019 guide'. 


### Add remote notebooks

You can get your notebooks version of choice, since the notebooks are sourced remotely. To add a remote notebook from Azure Data Studio (ADS), you can use keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl + Shift + P' or from 'View' and select 'Command Palette', as shown below:

![ADS Palette](media/view-cluster-status/bdc-ads-palette.png)

You'll find an option 'Jupyter Books: Add Remote Book' and you'll see a panel that allows you to select notebooks for the version of your choice.

![BDC remote guides](media/view-cluster-status/bdc-remote-guides.png)

After clicking on 'Add', you'll gain access of all the notebooks of the version of your choice under the 'Notebooks' tab of Azure Data Studio, as shown below: 

![BDC ADS guides](media/view-cluster-status/bdc-ads-guides.png)


### How to use these notebooks 

You can find the guide about how to use those notebooks from the following articles:

- [Monitor BDC Cluster with Juypter notebooks and Azure Data Studio](cluster-monitor-notebooks.md)
- [Gathering and analyzing logs in the cluster with notebooks](cluster-logging-notebooks.md)
- [Troubleshoot pyspark notebook](troubleshoot-pyspark-notebook.md)
- [Troubleshoot BDC Cluster with Juypter notebooks and Azure Data Studio (ADS)](cluster-troubleshooter-notebooks.md)
