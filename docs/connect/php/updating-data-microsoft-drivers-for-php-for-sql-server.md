# Updating data (Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server)

[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

The articles in this section address how to update data in a database by examining common use cases.

The steps for using the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)] to update data in a database can be summarized as follows:

1. Define a Transact-SQL query that does an insert, update, or delete operation.
2. Update parameter values for parameterized queries.
3. Execute the Transact-SQL queries with the updated parameter values (if applicable). For more information about executing a query, see [Comparing Execution Functions](comparing-execution-functions.md).
