# Configure Windows Service Accounts and Permissions

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Each service in SQL Server represents a process or a set of processes to manage authentication of SQL Server operations with Windows. This topic describes the default configuration of services in this release of SQL Server, and configuration options for SQL Server services that you can set during and after SQL Server installation. This topic helps advanced users understand the details of the service accounts.

Most services and their properties can be configured by using SQL Server Configuration Manager. Here are the paths to the last four versions when Windows is installed on the C drive.

| SQL Server version | Path |
|--------------------|------|
| SQL Server 2019 | C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager15.msc |
| SQL Server 2017 | C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager14.msc |
| SQL Server 2016 | C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager13.msc |
| [SQL Server 2014](/previous-versions/sql/2014/) | C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager12.msc |
| [SQL Server 2012](/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2012/hh231622(v=sql.110)) | C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager11.msc |

## <a name="Service_Details"></a> Services Installed by SQL Server

Depending on the components that you decide to install, SQL Server Setup installs the following services:

- **SQL Server Database Services** - The service for the SQL Server relational [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]. The executable file is \<MSSQLPATH>\MSSQL\Binn\sqlservr.exe.
- **SQL Server Agent** - Executes jobs, monitors SQL Server, fires alerts, and enables automation of some administrative tasks. The SQL Server Agent service is present but disabled on instances of [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)]. The executable file is \<MSSQLPATH>\MSSQL\Binn\sqlagent.exe.
- **[!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]** - Provides online analytical processing (OLAP) and data mining functionality for business intelligence applications. The executable file is \<MSSQLPATH>\OLAP\Bin\msmdsrv.exe.
- **[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]** - Manages, executes, creates, schedules, and delivers reports. The executable file is \<MSSQLPATH>\Reporting Services\ReportServer\Bin\ReportingServicesService.exe.
- **[!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]** - Provides management support for [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] package storage and execution. The executable path is \<MSSQLPATH>\130\DTS\Binn\MsDtsSrvr.exe

   [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] may include additional services for scale-out deployments. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Set up Integration Services (SSIS) Scale Out](../../integration-services/scale-out/walkthrough-set-up-integration-services-scale-out.md).

- **SQL Server Browser** - The name resolution service that provides SQL Server connection information for client computers. The executable path is c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\90\Shared\sqlbrowser.exe
- **Full-text search** - Quickly creates full-text indexes on content and properties of structured and semistructured data to provide document filtering and word-breaking for SQL Server.
- **SQL Writer** - Allows backup and restore applications to operate in the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) framework.
- **SQL Server Distributed Replay Controller** - Provides trace replay orchestration across multiple Distributed Replay client computers.
- **SQL Server Distributed Replay Client** - One or more Distributed Replay client computers that work together with a Distributed Replay controller to simulate concurrent workloads against an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)].
- **[!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad](../../includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)]**- A trusted service that hosts external executables that are provided by Microsoft, such as the R or Python runtimes installed as part of R Services or Machine Learning Services. Satellite processes can be launched by the Launchpad process but is resource governed based on the configuration of the individual instance. The Launchpad service runs under its own user account, and each satellite process for a specific, registered runtime inherits the user account of the Launchpad. Satellite processes are created and destroyed on demand during execution time.

  Launchpad can't create the accounts it uses if you install SQL Server on a computer that is also used as a domain controller. Hence, setup of R Services (In-Database) or Machine Learning Services (In-Database) fails on a domain controller.

- **SQL Server PolyBase Engine** - Provides distributed query capabilities to external data sources.
- **SQL Server PolyBase Data Movement Service** - Enables data movement between SQL Server and External Data Sources and between SQL nodes in PolyBase Scaleout Groups.

## CEIP services installed by SQL Server

The [Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) service](../../sql-server/usage-and-diagnostic-data-in-local-audit.md) sends [telemetry](../../sql-server/sql-server-privacy.md) data back to Microsoft.

Depending on the components that you decide to install, SQL Server setup installs the following CEIP services:

- **[SQLTELEMETRY](../../sql-server/usage-and-diagnostic-data-in-local-audit.md)** - The Customer Experience Improvement Program that sends database engine [telemetry](../../sql-server/sql-server-privacy.md) data back to Microsoft.
- **SSASTELEMETRY** - The Customer Experience Improvement Program that sends SSAS [telemetry](../../sql-server/sql-server-privacy.md) data back to Microsoft.
- **SSISTELEMETRY** - The Customer Experience Improvement Program that sends SSIS [telemetry](../../sql-server/sql-server-privacy.md) data back to Microsoft.

## <a name="Serv_Prop"></a> Service Properties and Configuration

Startup accounts used to start and run SQL Server can be [domain user accounts](#Domain_User), [local user accounts](#Local_User), [managed service accounts](#MSA), [virtual accounts](#VA_Desc), or [built-in system accounts](#Local_Service). To start and run, each service in SQL Server must have a startup account configured during installation.

This section describes the accounts that can be configured to start SQL Server services, the default values used by SQL Server Setup, the concept of per-service SID's, the startup options, and configuring the firewall.

- [Default Service Accounts](#Default_Accts)
- [Automatic Startup](#Auto_Start)
- [Configuring Service StartupType](#Configure_services)
- [Firewall Port](#Firewall)

### <a name="Default_Accts"></a> Default Service Accounts

The following table lists the default service accounts used by setup when installing all components. The default accounts listed are the recommended accounts, except as noted.

**Stand-alone Server or Domain Controller**

#### <a name="Changing_Accounts"></a> Changing Account Properties

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Always use SQL Server tools such as SQL Server Configuration Manager to change the account used by the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] or SQL Server Agent services, or to change the password for the account. In addition to changing the account name, SQL Server Configuration Manager performs additional configuration such as updating the Windows local security store which protects the service master key for the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]. Other tools such as the Windows Services Control Manager can change the account name but Don't change all the required settings.
> - For [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] instances that you deploy in a SharePoint farm, always use SharePoint Central Administration to change the server accounts for [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiMTS](../../includes/ssgeminimts-md.md)] applications and the [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiSrv](../../includes/ssgeminisrv-md.md)]. Associated settings and permissions are updated to use the new account information when you use Central Administration.
> - To change [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] options, use the Reporting Services Configuration Tool.

### <a name="New_Accounts"></a> Managed Service Accounts, Group-Managed Service Accounts, and Virtual Accounts

Managed service accounts, group-managed service accounts, and virtual accounts are designed to provide crucial applications such as SQL Server with the isolation of their own accounts, while eliminating the need for an administrator to manually administer the Service Principal Name (SPN) and credentials for these accounts. These make long-term management of service account users, passwords and SPNs much easier.

- <a name="MSA"></a> **Managed Service Accounts**

  A Managed Service Account (MSA) is a type of domain account created and managed by the domain controller. It is assigned to a single member computer for use running a service. The password is managed automatically by the domain controller. You can't use an MSA to log into a computer, but a computer can use an MSA to start a Windows service. An MSA has the ability to register a Service Principal Name (SPN) within Active Directory when given read and write servicePrincipalName permissions. An MSA is named with a **$** suffix, for example **DOMAIN\ACCOUNTNAME$**. When specifying an MSA, leave the password blank. Because an MSA is assigned to a single computer, it can't be used on different nodes of a Windows cluster.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The MSA must be created in the Active Directory by the domain administrator before SQL Server setup can use it for SQL Server services.

- <a name="GMSA"></a> **Group-Managed Service Accounts**

  A Group-Managed Service Account (gMSA) is an MSA for multiple servers. Windows manages a service account for services running on a group of servers. Active Directory automatically updates the group-managed service account password without restarting services. You can configure SQL Server services to use a group-managed service account principal. Beginning with SQL Server 2014, SQL Server supports group-managed service accounts for standalone instances, and SQL Server 2016 and later for failover cluster instances, and availability groups.

  To use a gMSA for SQL Server 2014 or later, the operating system must be Windows Server 2012 R2 or later. Servers with Windows Server 2012 R2 require [KB 2998082](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2998082) applied so that the services can log in without disruption immediately after a password change.

  For more information, see [Group Managed Service Accounts](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831782(v=ws.11))

  > [!NOTE]
  > The gMSA must be created in the Active Directory by the domain administrator before SQL Server setup can use it for SQL Server services.

- <a name="VA_Desc"></a>**Virtual Accounts**

  Virtual accounts (beginning with Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7) are *managed local accounts* that provide the following features to simplify service administration. The virtual account is auto-managed, and the virtual account can access the network in a domain environment. If the default value is used for the service accounts during SQL Server setup, a virtual account using the instance name as the service name is used, in the format **NT SERVICE\\**_\<SERVICENAME>_. Services that run as virtual accounts access network resources by using the credentials of the computer account in the format *<domain_name>*__\\__*<computer_name>*__$__. When specifying a virtual account to start SQL Server, leave the password blank. If the virtual account fails to register the Service Principal Name (SPN), register the SPN manually. For more information on registering an SPN manually, see [Manual SPN Registration](register-a-service-principal-name-for-kerberos-connections.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Virtual accounts can't be used for SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance, because the virtual account would not have the same SID on each node of the cluster.

  The following table lists examples of virtual account names.

  |Service|Virtual Account Name|
  |-------------|--------------------------|
  |Default instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] service|**NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER**|
  |Named instance of a [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] service named **PAYROLL**|**NT SERVICE\MSSQL$PAYROLL**|
  |SQL Server Agent service on the default instance of SQL Server|**NT SERVICE\SQLSERVERAGENT**|
  |SQL Server Agent service on an instance of SQL Server named **PAYROLL**|**NT SERVICE\SQLAGENT$PAYROLL**|

For more information on Managed Service Accounts and Virtual Accounts, see the **Managed service account and virtual account concepts** section of [Service Accounts Step-by-Step Guide](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd548356\(WS.10\).aspx) and [Managed Service Accounts Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff641729\(WS.10\).aspx).

> [!Note]
> [!INCLUDE[ssNoteLowRights](../../includes/ssnotelowrights-md.md)] Use a [MSA](#MSA), [gMSA](#GMSA) or [virtual account](#VA_Desc) when possible. When MSA, gMSA and virtual accounts aren't possible, use a specific low-privilege user account or domain account instead of a shared account for SQL Server services. Use separate accounts for different SQL Server services. Don't grant additional permissions to the SQL Server service account or the service groups. Permissions are granted through group membership or granted directly to a service SID, where a service SID is supported.

### <a name="Auto_Start"></a> Automatic startup

In addition to having user accounts, every service has three possible startup states that users can control:

- **Disabled** The service is installed but not currently running.
- **Manual** The service is installed, but starts only when another service or application needs its functionality.
- **Automatic** The service is automatically started by the operating system.

The startup state is selected during setup. When installing a named instance, the SQL Server Browser service should be set to start automatically.

### <a name="Configure_services"></a> Configuring services during unattended installation

The following table shows the SQL Server services that can be configured during installation. For unattended installations, you can use the switches in a configuration file or at a command prompt.

|SQL Server service name|Switches for unattended installations\*|
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|MSSQLSERVER|SQLSVCACCOUNT, SQLSVCPASSWORD, SQLSVCSTARTUPTYPE|
|SQLServerAgent\*\*|AGTSVCACCOUNT, AGTSVCPASSWORD, AGTSVCSTARTUPTYPE|
|MSSQLServerOLAPService|ASSVCACCOUNT, ASSVCPASSWORD, ASSVCSTARTUPTYPE|
|ReportServer|RSSVCACCOUNT, RSSVCPASSWORD, RSSVCSTARTUPTYPE|
|[!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]|ISSVCACCOUNT, ISSVCPASSWORD, ISSVCSTARTUPTYPE|
|SQL Server Distributed Replay Controller|DRU_CTLR, CTLRSVCACCOUNT, CTLRSVCPASSWORD, CTLRSTARTUPTYPE, CTLRUSERS|
|SQL Server Distributed Replay Client|DRU_CLT, CLTSVCACCOUNT, CLTSVCPASSWORD, CLTSTARTUPTYPE, CLTCTLRNAME, CLTWORKINGDIR, CLTRESULTDIR|
|R Services or Machine Learning Services|EXTSVCACCOUNT, EXTSVCPASSWORD, ADVANCEDANALYTICS\*\*\*|
|PolyBase Engine| PBENGSVCACCOUNT, PBENGSVCPASSWORD, PBENGSVCSTARTUPTYPE, PBDMSSVCACCOUNT, PBDMSSVCPASSWORD, PBDMSSVCSTARTUPTYPE, PBSCALEOUT, PBPORTRANGE

\*For more information and sample syntax for unattended installations, see [Install SQL Server 2016 from the Command Prompt](../install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-command-prompt.md).

\*\*The SQL Server Agent service is disabled on instances of [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] with Advanced Services.

\*\*\*Setting the account for Launchpad through the switches alone isn't currently supported. Use SQL Server Configuration Manager to change the account and other service settings.

### <a name="Firewall"></a> Firewall Port

In most cases, when initially installed, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] can be connected to by tools such as [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] installed on the same computer as SQL Server. SQL Server Setup doesn't open ports in the Windows firewall. Connections from other computers may not be possible until the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] is configured to listen on a TCP port, and the appropriate port is opened for connections in the Windows firewall. For more information, see [Configure the Windows Firewall to Allow SQL Server Access](../../sql-server/install/configure-the-windows-firewall-to-allow-sql-server-access.md).

## <a name="Serv_Perm"></a> Service Permissions

This section describes the permissions that SQL Server Setup configures for the per-service SID's of the SQL Server services.

- [Service Configuration and Access Control](#Serv_SID)
- [Windows Privileges and Rights](#Windows)
- [File System Permissions Granted to SQL Server Per-service SIDs or SQL Server Local Windows Groups](#Reviewing_ACLs)
- [File System Permissions Granted to Other Windows User Accounts or Groups](#File_System_Other)
- [File System Permissions Related to Unusual Disk Locations](#Unusual_Locations)
- [Reviewing Additional Considerations](#Review_additional_considerations)
- [Registry Permissions](#Registry)
- [WMI](#WMI)
- [Named Pipes](#Pipes)

### <a name="Serv_SID"></a> Service Configuration and Access Control

SQL Server enables per-service SID for each of its services to provide service isolation and defense in depth. The per-service SID is derived from the service name and is unique to that service. For example, a service SID name for a named instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] service might be **NT Service\MSSQL$**_\<InstanceName>_. Service isolation enables access to specific objects without the need to run a high-privilege account or weaken the security protection of the object. By using an access control entry that contains a service SID, a SQL Server service can restrict access to its resources.

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows 7 and [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../../includes/nextref-longhorn-md.md)] R2 (and later) the per-service SID can be the virtual account used by the service.

For most components SQL Server configures the ACL for the per-service account directly, so changing the service account can be done without having to repeat the resource ACL process.

When installing [!INCLUDE[ssAS](../../includes/ssas-md.md)], a per-service SID for the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] service is created. A local Windows group is created, named in the format **SQLServerMSASUser$**_computer_name_**$**_instance_name_. The per-service SID **NT SERVICE\MSSQLServerOLAPService** is granted membership in the local Windows group, and the local Windows group is granted the appropriate permissions in the ACL. If the account used to start the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] service is changed, SQL Server Configuration Manager must change some Windows permissions (such as the right to log on as a service), but the permissions assigned to the local Windows group is still available without any updating, because the per-service SID hasn't changed. This method allows the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] service to be renamed during upgrades.

During SQL Server installation, SQL Server Setup creates a local Windows group for [!INCLUDE[ssAS](../../includes/ssas-md.md)] and the SQL Server Browser service. For these services, SQL Server configures the ACL for the local Windows groups.

Depending on the service configuration, the service account for a service or service SID is added as a member of the service group during install or upgrade.

### <a name="Windows"></a> Windows Privileges and Rights

The account assigned to start a service needs the **Start, stop and pause permission** for the service. The SQL Server Setup program automatically assigns this. First install Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT). See [Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=45520).

The following table shows permissions that SQL Server Setup requests for the per-service SIDs or local Windows groups used by SQL Server components.

|SQL Server Service|Permissions granted by SQL Server Setup|
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|**[!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]:**<br /><br /> (All rights are granted to the per-service SID. Default instance: **NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER**.

 \*The SQL Server Agent service is disabled on instances of [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)].

### <a name="Reviewing_ACLs"></a> File System Permissions Granted to SQL Server Per-service SIDs or Local Windows Groups

SQL Server service accounts must have access to resources. Access control lists are set for the per-service SID or the local Windows group.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For failover cluster installations, resources on shared disks must be set to an ACL for a local account.

The following table shows the ACLs that are set by SQL Server Setup:

\*The SQL Server Agent service is disabled on instances of [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] with Advanced Services.

When database files are stored in a user-defined location, you must grant the per-service SID access to that location. For more information about granting file system permissions to a per-service SID, see [Configure File System Permissions for Database Engine Access](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-file-system-permissions-for-database-engine-access.md).

### <a name="File_System_Other"></a> File System Permissions Granted to Other Windows User Accounts or Groups

Some access control permissions might have to be granted to built-in accounts or other SQL Server service accounts. The following table lists additional ACLs that are set by SQL Server Setup.

\*This is the WMI provider namespace.

### <a name="Unusual_Locations"></a> File System Permissions Related to Unusual Disk Locations

The default drive for locations for installation is **system drive**, normally drive C. This section describes additional considerations when tempdb or user databases are installed to unusual locations.

**Non-default drive**

When installed to a local drive that isn't the default drive, the per-service SID must have access to the file location. SQL Server Setup provisions the required access.

**Network share**

When databases are installed to a network share, the service account must have access to the file location of the user and tempdb databases. SQL Server Setup can't provision access to a network share. The user must provision access to a tempdb location for the service account before running setup. The user must provision access to the user database location before creating the database.

> [!NOTE]
> Virtual accounts can't be authenticated to a remote location. All virtual accounts use the permission of machine account. Provision the machine account in the format _<domain_name>_**\\**_<computer_name>_**$**.

### <a name="Review_additional_considerations"></a> Reviewing Additional Considerations

The following table shows the permissions that are required for SQL Server services to provide additional functionality.

|Service/Application|Functionality|Required permission|
|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
|SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)|Write to a mail slot using xp_sendmail.|Network write permissions.|
|SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)|Run xp_cmdshell for a user other than a SQL Server administrator.|Act as part of operating system and replace a process-level token.|
|SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER)|Use the auto restart feature.|Must be a member of the Administrators local group.|
|[!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] Tuning Advisor|Tunes databases for optimal query performance.|On first use, a user who has system administrative credentials must initialize the application. After initialization, dbo users can use the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] Tuning Advisor to tune only those tables that they own. For more information, see "Initializing [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] Tuning Advisor on First Use" in SQL Server Books Online.|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you upgrade SQL Server, enable SQL Server Agent and verify the required default configuration: that the SQL Server Agent service account is a member of the SQL Server **sysadmin** fixed server role.

### <a name="Registry"></a> Registry Permissions

The registry hive is created under **HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\\**_<Instance_ID>_ for instance-aware components. For example

- **HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MyInstance**
- **HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSASSQL13.MyInstance**
- **HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.130**

The registry also maintains a mapping of instance ID to instance name. Instance ID to instance name mapping is maintained as follows:

- **[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\Instance Names\SQL] "InstanceName"="MSSQL13"**
- **[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\Instance Names\OLAP] "InstanceName"="MSASSQL13"**
- **[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\Instance Names\RS] "InstanceName"="MSRSSQL13"**

### <a name="WMI"></a> WMI

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) must be able to connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]. To support this, the per-service SID of the Windows WMI provider (**NT SERVICE\winmgmt**) is provisioned in the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].

The SQL WMI provider requires the following minimal permissions:

- Membership in the **db_ddladmin** or **db_owner** fixed database roles in the msdb database.
- **CREATE DDL EVENT NOTIFICATION** permission in the server.
- **CREATE TRACE EVENT NOTIFICATION** permission in the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].
- **VIEW ANY DATABASE** server-level permission.

  SQL Server setup creates a SQL WMI namespace and grants read permission to the SQL Server Agent service-SID.

### <a name="Pipes"></a> Named Pipes

In all installation, SQL Server Setup provides access to the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] through the shared memory protocol, which is a local named pipe.

## <a name="Provisioning"></a> Provisioning

This section describes how accounts are provisioned inside the various SQL Server components.

- [Database Engine Provisioning](#DE_Prov)

  - [Windows Principals](#Win_Principals)
  - [sa Account](#sa)
  - [SQL Server Per-service SID Login and Privileges](#Logins)
  - [SQL Server Agent Login and Privileges](#Agent)
  - [HADRON and SQL Failover Cluster Instance and Privileges](#Hadron)
  - [SQL Writer and Privileges](#Writer)
  - [SQL WMI and Privileges](#SQLWMI)
- [SSAS Provisioning](#SSAS)
- [SSRS Provisioning](#SSRS)

### <a name="DE_Prov"></a> Database Engine Provisioning

The following accounts are added as logins in the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)].

#### <a name="Win_Principals"></a> Windows Principals

During setup, SQL Server Setup requires at least one user account to be named as a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role.

#### <a name="sa"></a> sa Account

The **sa** account is always present as a [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] login and is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role. When the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] is installed using only Windows Authentication (that is when SQL Server Authentication isn't enabled), the **sa** login is still present but is disabled and the password is complex and random. For information about enabling the **sa** account, see [Change Server Authentication Mode](../../database-engine/configure-windows/change-server-authentication-mode.md).

#### <a name="Logins"></a> SQL Server Per-service SID Login and Privileges

The per-service SID (sometimes also called service security principal (SID)) of the SQL Server service is provisioned as a [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] login. The per-service SID login is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role. For information about per-service SID, see [Using Service SIDs to grant permissions to services in SQL Server](../../relational-databases/security/using-service-sids-to-grant-permissions-to-services-in-sql-server.md).

#### <a name="Agent"></a> SQL Server Agent Login and Privileges

The per-service SID of the SQL Server Agent service is provisioned as a [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] login. The per-service SID login is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role.

#### <a name="Hadron"></a> [!INCLUDE[ssHADRc](../../includes/sshadrc-md.md)] and SQL Failover Cluster Instance and Privileges

When installing the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] as a [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] or SQL Failover Cluster Instance (SQL FCI), **LOCAL SYSTEM** is provisioned in the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]. The **LOCAL SYSTEM** login is granted the **ALTER ANY AVAILABILITY GROUP** permission (for [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../includes/sshadr-md.md)]) and the **VIEW SERVER STATE** permission (for SQL FCI).

#### <a name="Writer"></a> SQL Writer and Privileges

The per-service SID of the SQL Server VSS Writer service is provisioned as a [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] login. The per-service SID login is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role.

#### <a name="SQLWMI"></a> SQL WMI and Privileges

SQL Server Set up provisions the **NT SERVICE\Winmgmt** account as a [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] login and adds it to the **sysadmin** fixed server role.

#### SSRS Provisioning

The account specified during setup is provisioned as a member of the **RSExecRole** database role. For more information, see [Configure the Report Server Service Account &#40;SSRS Configuration Manager&#41;](../../reporting-services/install-windows/configure-the-report-server-service-account-ssrs-configuration-manager.md).

### <a name="SSAS"></a> SSAS Provisioning

[!INCLUDE[ssAS](../../includes/ssas-md.md)] service account requirements vary depending on how you deploy the server. If you're installing [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiShort](../../includes/ssgeminishort-md.md)], SQL Server Setup requires that you configure the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] service to run under a domain account. Domain accounts are required to support the managed account facility that is built into SharePoint. For this reason, SQL Server Setup doesn't provide a default service account, such as a virtual account, for a [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiShort](../../includes/ssgeminishort-md.md)] installation. For more information about provisioning [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint, see [Configure Power Pivot Service Accounts](/analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/configure-power-pivot-service-accounts).

For all other standalone [!INCLUDE[ssAS](../../includes/ssas-md.md)] installations, you can provision the service to run under a domain account, built-in system account, managed account, or virtual account. For more information about account provisioning, see [Configure Service Accounts &#40;Analysis Services&#41;](/analysis-services/instances/configure-service-accounts-analysis-services).

For clustered installations, you must specify a domain account or a built-in system account. Neither managed accounts nor virtual accounts are supported for [!INCLUDE[ssAS](../../includes/ssas-md.md)] failover clusters.

All [!INCLUDE[ssAS](../../includes/ssas-md.md)] installations require that you specify a system administrator of the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] instance. Administrator privileges are provisioned in the Analysis Services **Server** role.

### <a name="SSRS"></a> SSRS Provisioning

The account specified during setup is provisioned in the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] as a member of the **RSExecRole** database role. For more information, see [Configure the Report Server Service Account &#40;SSRS Configuration Manager&#41;](../../reporting-services/install-windows/configure-the-report-server-service-account-ssrs-configuration-manager.md).

## <a name="Upgrade"></a> Upgrading From Previous Versions

This section describes the changes made during upgrade from a previous version of SQL Server.

- [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] requires a supported [operating system](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server-ver15.md#operating-system-support). Any previous version of SQL Server running on a lower operating system version must have the operating system upgraded before upgrading SQL Server.
- During upgrade of [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] to [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] setup configures the SQL Server instance in the following way:

  - The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] runs with the security context of the per-service SID. The per-service SID is granted access to the file folders of the SQL Server instance (such as DATA), and the SQL Server registry keys.
  - The per-service SID of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] is provisioned in the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] as a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role.
  - The per-service SID's are added to the local SQL Server Windows groups, unless SQL Server is a Failover Cluster Instance.
  - The SQL Server resources remain provisioned to the local SQL Server Windows groups.
  - The local Windows group for services is renamed from **SQLServer2005MSSQLUser$**_<computer_name>_**$**_<instance_name>_ to **SQLServerMSSQLUser$**_<computer_name>_**$**_<instance_name>_. File locations for migrated databases has Access Control Entries (ACE) for the local Windows groups. The file locations for new databases has ACE's for the per-service SID.

- During upgrade from [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)], SQL Server Setup preserves the ACE's for the [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] per-service SID.
- For a SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance, the ACE for the domain account configured for the service are retained.

## <a name="Appendix"></a> Appendix

This section contains additional information about SQL Server services.

- [Description of Service Accounts](#Serv_Accts)
- [Identifying Instance-Aware and Instance-Unaware Services](#Identify_instance_aware_and_unaware)
- [Localized Service Names](#Localized_service_names)

### <a name="Serv_Accts"></a> Description of Service Accounts

The service account is the account used to start a Windows service, such as the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]. For running SQL Server, it isn't required to add the Service Account as a Login to SQL Server in addition to the Service SID, which is always present and a member of the **sysamin** fixed server role.

#### <a name="Any_OS"></a> Accounts Available With Any Operating System

In addition to the new [MSA](#MSA), [gMSA](#GMSA) and [virtual accounts](#VA_Desc) described earlier, the following accounts can be used.

<a name="Domain_User"></a> **Domain User Account**

If the service must interact with network services, access domain resources like file shares or if it uses linked server connections to other computers running SQL Server, you might use a minimally-privileged domain account. Many server-to-server activities can be performed only with a domain user account. This account should be pre-created by domain administration in your environment.

> [!NOTE]
> If you configure the SQL Server to use a domain account, you can isolate the privileges for the Service, but must manually manage passwords or create a custom solution for managing these passwords. Many server applications use this strategy to enhance security, but this strategy requires additional administration and complexity. In these deployments, service administrators spend a considerable amount of time on maintenance tasks such as managing service passwords and service principal names (SPNs), which are required for Kerberos authentication. In addition, these maintenance tasks can disrupt service.

<a name="Local_User"></a> **Local User Accounts**

If the computer isn't part of a domain, a local user account without Windows administrator permissions is recommended.

<a name="Local_Service"></a> **Local Service Account**

The Local Service account is a built-in account that has the same level of access to resources and objects as members of the Users group. This limited access helps safeguard the system if individual services or processes are compromised. Services that run as the Local Service account access network resources as a null session without credentials. 
> [!NOTE]
> The Local Service account isn't supported for the SQL Server or SQL Server Agent services. Local Service isn't supported as the account running those services because it is a shared service and any other services running under local service would have system administrator access to SQL Server.
The actual name of the account is **NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE**.

<a name="Network_Service"></a> **Network Service Account**

The Network Service account is a built-in account that has more access to resources and objects than members of the Users group. Services that run as the Network Service account access network resources by using the credentials of the computer account in the format _<domain_name>_**\\**_<computer_name>_**$**. The actual name of the account is **NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE**.

<a name="Local_System"></a> **Local System Account**

Local System is a very high-privileged built-in account. It has extensive privileges on the local system and acts as the computer on the network. The actual name of the account is **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**.

### <a name="Identify_instance_aware_and_unaware"></a> Identifying Instance-Aware and Instance-Unaware Services

Instance-aware services are associated with a specific instance of SQL Server, and have their own registry hives. You can install multiple copies of instance-aware services by running SQL Server Setup for each component or service. Instance-unaware services are shared among all installed SQL Server instances. They aren't associated with a specific instance, are installed only once, and can't be installed side by side.

Instance-aware services in SQL Server include the following:

- SQL Server
- SQL Server Agent

   Be aware that the SQL Server Agent service is disabled on instances of [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] with Advanced Services.

- [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]\*
- [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]
- Full-text search

  Instance-unaware services in SQL Server include the following:

- [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]
- SQL Server Browser
- SQL Writer

 \*Analysis Services in SharePoint integrated mode runs as '[!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)]' as a single, named instance. The instance name is fixed. You can't specify a different name. You can install only one instance of Analysis Services running as '[!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)]' on each physical server.

### <a name="Localized_service_names"></a> Localized Service Names

The following table shows service names that are displayed by localized versions of Windows.

|Language|Name for Local Service|Name for Network Service|Name for Local System|Name for Admin Group|
|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
