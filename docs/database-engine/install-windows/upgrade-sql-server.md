# Upgrade SQL Server
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server -Windows Only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only.md)]
 
 You can upgrade instances of [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ss2016](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[sssql17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] directly to [!INCLUDE[sssql19](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)]. For [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)], you'll either need to do a side-by-side upgrade, or a migration, to move to [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] as there is no common overlap between a supported mainstream operating system. Before running setup to upgrade, review the following articles about the upgrade process and the release notes.  
  
Check out what's new in each version of the product: 
   - [SQL Server 2019 Release Notes](../../sql-server/sql-server-version-15-release-notes.md)
   - [SQL Server 2017 Release Notes](../../sql-server/sql-server-2017-release-notes.md) 
   - [SQL Server 2016 Release Notes](../../sql-server/sql-server-2016-release-notes.md) 
   
If you're upgrading from an end-of-support version of SQL Server such as SQL Server 2005, 2008, and 2008 R2, see the [end of support options](../../sql-server/end-of-support/sql-server-end-of-life-overview.md).
