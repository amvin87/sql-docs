# Query Store hints (Preview)
[!INCLUDE [asdb-asdbmi](../../includes/applies-to-version/asdb-asdbmi.md)]

This article outlines the Query Store hints feature of the [Query Store](monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store.md). The Query Store hints feature provides an easy-to-use method for shaping query plans without changing application code. 

> [!Note]
> Query Store hints are a public preview feature currently available in [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)] â€“ including in Azure SQL single databases, elastic pools, managed instances, and hyperscale databases.  

## Overview

Ideally the Query Optimizer selects an optimal execution plan for a query. When this doesn't happen, a developer or DBA may wish to manually optimize for specific conditions. Query hints are specified via the OPTION clause and can be used to affect query execution behavior. While query hints help provide localized solutions to various performance-related issues, they do require a rewrite of the original query text. Database administrators and developers may not always be able to make changes directly to [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] code to inject a query hint. The [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] may be hard-coded into an application or automatically generated by the application. Previously, a developer may have to rely on [plan guides](plan-guides.md), which can be complex to use.

## When to use Query Store hints

As the name suggests, this feature extends and depends on the [Query Store](monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store.md). Query Store enables the capturing of queries, execution plans, and associated runtime statistics. Introduced in [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] and on-by-default in [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)], Query Store greatly simplifies the overall performance tuning customer experience.  

:::image type="complex" source="media/query-store-hints.png" alt-text="The workflow for Query Store Hints.":::
      First the query is executed, then captured by Query Store. Then the DBA creates a Query Store hint on a query. Thereafter, the query is executed using the Query Store hint.
:::image-end:::

Examples where Query Store hints can help with query-level performance issues:
*    Recompile a query on each execution.
*    Cap the memory grant size for a bulk insert operation.
*    Limit the maximum degree of parallelism for a statistics update operation.
*    Use a Hash join instead of a Nested Loops join.
*    Use [compatibility level](../databases/view-or-change-the-compatibility-level-of-a-database.md) 110 for a specific query while keeping everything else in the database at compatibility level 150.
*    Disable row goal optimization for a SELECT TOP query.

To use Query Store hints, do the following:
1.    Identify the Query Store query_id of the query statement you wish to modify. You can do this in various ways: 
    1.1. Querying the [Query Store catalog views](../system-catalog-views/query-store-catalog-views-transact-sql.md).
    1.2. Using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] built-in Query Store reports.
    1.3. Using Azure portal Query Performance Insight for [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].
1.    Execute sp_query_store_set_hints with the query_id and query hint string you wish to apply to the query.  This string can contain one or more query hints. For complete information, see [sys.sp_query_store_set_hints](../system-stored-procedures/sys-sp-query-store-set-hints-transact-sql.md).

Once created, Query Store hints are persisted and survive restarts and failovers. Query Store hints override hard-coded statement level hints and existing plan guide hints. 

If a query hint contradicts what is possible for query optimization, the hint will not block query execution and the hint will not be applied. In the cases where a hint would cause a query to fail, the hint is ignored and the latest failure details can be viewed in [sys.query_store_query_hints](../system-catalog-views/sys-query-store-query-hints-transact-sql.md).

## Query Store hints system stored procedures

To create or update hints, use [sys.sp_query_store_set_hints](../system-stored-procedures/sys-sp-query-store-set-hints-transact-sql.md).
 
Hints are specified in a valid string format N'OPTION (...)'. 

> [!Note]
> For a complete list of hints that are supported, see [sys.sp_query_store_set_hints](../system-stored-procedures/sys-sp-query-store-set-hints-transact-sql.md).

* If no Query Store hint exists for a specific query_id, a new Query Store hint will be created. 
* If a Query Store hint already exists for a specific query_id, the last value provided will override previously specified values for the associated query. 
* If a query_id doesn't exist, an error will be raised. 

To remove hints associated with a query_id, use [sys.sp_query_store_clear_hints](../system-stored-procedures/sys-sp-query-store-clear-hints-transact-sql.md).

## Execution Plan XML attributes

When hints are applied, the following will be surfaced in the StmtSimple element of the [Execution Plan](execution-plans.md) in [XML format](save-an-execution-plan-in-xml-format.md):

|Attribute| Description|
|--|--|
|QueryStoreStatementHintText|Actual Query Store hint(s) applied to the query|
|QueryStoreStatementHintId|Unique identifier of a query hint|
|QueryStoreStatementHintSource|Source of Query Store hint (ex: "User")|

> [!Note]
> During the Query Store hints public preview, these XML elements will be available only via the output of the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] commands [SET STATISTICS XML](../../t-sql/statements/set-statistics-xml-transact-sql.md) and [SET SHOWPLAN XML](../../t-sql/statements/set-showplan-xml-transact-sql.md).


## Examples  

### A. Query Store hints demo
The following walk-through of the Query Store hints feature in Azure SQL Database uses an imported database via a BACPAC file (.bacpac). Learn how to import a new database to an Azure SQL Database server, see [Quickstart: Import a BACPAC file to a database](/azure/azure-sql/database/database-import).

:::code language="tsql" source="../../../sql-server-samples/samples/features/query-store/query_store_hints_demo.sql":::

### B. Identify a query in Query Store

The following example queries [sys.query_store_query_text](../system-catalog-views/sys-query-store-query-text-transact-sql.md) and [sys.query_store_query](../system-catalog-views/sys-query-store-query-transact-sql.md) to return the query_id for an executed query text fragment:

```sql
SELECT q.query_id, qt.query_sql_text
FROM sys.query_store_query_text qt 
INNER JOIN sys.query_store_query q ON 
    qt.query_text_id = q.query_text_id 
WHERE query_sql_text like N'%ORDER BY ListingPrice DESC%'  
  AND query_sql_text not like N'%query_store%';
GO
```

 Then, apply the hint to enforce a maximum memory grant size in percent of configured memory limit to the query_id (in this example, query_id in the previous query's resultset was 39):
  
```sql
EXEC sys.sp_query_store_set_hints @query_id= 39, @query_hints = N'OPTION(MAX_GRANT_PERCENT=10)';
```  

 You can also apply query hints with the following syntax, for example the option to force the [legacy cardinality estimator](../performance/cardinality-estimation-sql-server.md):

```sql
EXEC sys.sp_query_store_set_hints @query_id= 39, @query_hints = N'OPTION(USE HINT(''FORCE_LEGACY_CARDINALITY_ESTIMATION''))';
```  

 You can apply multiple query hints with a comma-separated list:

```sql
EXEC sys.sp_query_store_set_hints @query_id= 39, @query_hints = N'OPTION(RECOMPILE, MAXDOP 1, USE HINT(''QUERY_OPTIMIZER_COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL_110''))';
```

 Review the Query Store hint in place for query_id 39:

```sql
SELECT query_hint_id, query_id, query_hint_text, last_query_hint_failure_reason, last_query_hint_failure_reason_desc, query_hint_failure_count, source, source_desc 
FROM sys.query_store_query_hints 
WHERE query_id = 39;
```
