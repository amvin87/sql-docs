## April 2021

### Breaking change

No breaking changes

### Other changes

A new property *LicenseType* has been added to the **SQL Server - Azure Arc** resource type. It indicates if your SQL Server instance requires a license. The property can have one of the following values:

| **Value** | **Description** |
|:--|:--|
|Paid|Indicates that the SQL instance uses Enterprise, Standard or Web edition of SQL Server|
|Free|Indicates that the SQL instance uses Express or Developer edition of SQL Server|
|HADR|Indicates that the SQL instance is a replica in an availability group. If it is covered by Software Assurance, it may not require a license. For more information, see [SQL Server Commercial Licensing Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering/SQLServer/EAEAS).

> [!NOTE]
> For the existing **SQL Server - Azure Arc** resources, this property will show a *Null* value. It will be automatically updated with the correct value after SQL Server on Azure Arc-enabled servers becomes generally available.

## December 2020

### Breaking change

This release introduces an updated [resource provider](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers) called `Microsoft.AzureArcData`. Before you can continue using SQL Server on Azure Arc-enabled servers, you need to register this resource provider. See the resource provider registration instructions in the [Prerequisites](connect.md#prerequisites) section.

If you have existing existing SQL Server - Azure Arc resources, use these steps to migrate them to Microsoft.AzureArcData namespace.

1. Launch the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/). For details, [read more about PowerShell in Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart-powershell).

2. Upload the script to the shell using the following command:

    ```console
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/master/samples/manage/azure-arc-enabled-sql-server/migrate-to-azure-arc-data.ps1 -o migrate-to-azure-arc-data.ps1
    ```
3. Run the script.  

    ```console
   ./migrate-to-azure-arc-data.ps1
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> - To paste the commands into the shell, use `Ctrl-Shift-V` on Windows or `Cmd-v` on MacOS.
> - The `curl` command will copy the script directly to the home folder associated with your Cloud Shell session.
> - The script will prompt for the resource group name and print a message when migration is completed.

### Other changes

* The *TCPPorts* property in the **SQL Server - Azure Arc** resource type has been renamed to *TCPStaticPorts*
* The permissions required aren’t as broad as they used to be. See the [Required permission](overview.md#required-permissions) section for details.

### Known issues

* The *CreateTime* property won’t be added to any newly created resources in the AzureArcData namespace, including the **SQL Server - Azure Arc** resources.

## October 2020

The October update includes the following improvements:

* The register SQL Server on Azure Arc-enabled servers blade now includes the **Tags** tab. The tags are included in the registration script and are reflected in the **SQL Server - Azure Arc** resource(s). For details, see [Connect your SQL Server to Azure Arc](connect.md).

* The **Environment Health** entry now supports activation of **SQL Assessment** from the Portal by deploying a *CustomScriptExtension*. For details, see [Configure SQL Assessment](assess.md#run-on-demand-sql-assessment).

### Known issues

The following issues apply to the October release:

* Connecting SQL Server instances to Azure Arc requires an account with a broad set of permissions. For details, see [Required permissions](overview.md#required-permissions).

## September 2020

SQL Server on Azure Arc-enabled servers is released for public preview. SQL Server on Azure Arc-enabled servers extends Azure services to SQL Server instances hosted outside of Azure in the customer’s datacenter, on the edge or in a multi-cloud environment.

For details, see [SQL Server on Azure Arc-enabled servers Overview](overview.md)

### Known issues

The following issues apply to the September release:

* The **Register SQL Server on Azure Arc-enabled servers** blade does not support configuring custom tags. To add custom tags, open the **SQL Server - Azure Arc** resource after registration and change Tags in the **Overview** page.

* Connecting SQL Server instances to Azure Arc requires an account with a broad set of permissions. For details, see [Required permissions](overview.md#required-permissions).
